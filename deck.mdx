## How?

### [`React-Hardware`](https://github.com/iamdustan/react-hardware)

### What is `React-Hardware`?
<Appear>
<p style={
	{ 
		margin: "0 40px", 
		padding: '10px', 
		borderLeft: '1px solid #fff',
		borderRight: '1px solid #fff'
	}}>
	<q>
		React Hardware enables you to build firmata-based hardware applications using a consistent developer 
		experience based on JavaScript and React.

### Basically...
<Appear>
	<p>It's React... Just your renderer is physical hardware, not a screen.</p>
</Appear>

--- 
## Some Caveats:
<ul>
	<Appear>
		<li>This renderer is <i>really</i> green.</li>
		<li>It easily qualifies as esoteric.</li>
		<li>It's <i>kinda</i> cheating.</li>
	</Appear>
</ul>

---
## Cheating?
<p style={paragraphOverride.p}>
	Once the USB cable is removed, this project stops working. The code runs via a protocol 
	called <a href="https://github.com/firmata/protocol" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" style={{ fontFamily: 'monospace'}}>Firmata</a>, 
	using a message format based on MIDI.
</p>

---
## Cheating?
<p style={paragraphOverride.p}>
	In essence, Node acts as closer to a server than many React applications and this Arduino
	is running a virtual machine.
</p>

---
## Cheating - Part Two, "I did it"
<p style={paragraphOverride.p}>
	For reasons that will soon become apparent, binary devices don't work great with React.
	In such circumstances, I've used Johnny-Five as a fallback. While supported, it's 
	almost against the intent of the project.
</p>

## Let's blink a light!

## Some Takeaways

<ul>
	<Appear>
		<li>React state transitions and binary components don't always mix well</li>
		<li>Linux is always better at talking directly to devices</li>
		<li>
			<q>
				...your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they <strong>could </strong>
				that they didn't stop to think if they <strong>should</strong>
			</q>
		</li>
	</Appear>
</ul>
